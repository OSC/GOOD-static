        <meta name="description" content="In the HPC space there is a push to improve accessibility and lower the entry barrier to users. Thus, they can focus solely on science and not deal with the intricacies of HPC systems, which can be pretty obscure to non HPC experts. The OOD platform is the result of such efforts and has become sort of a standard: many of the supercomputers around the world provide it as one of the ways to access and interact with the HPC system. 
OOD deals mainly with accessibility to the HPC resources, but there is another aspect to accessibility: scientific software availability. Installation of scientific software is rather complex, since it is not sufficient for it to work, but must also perform.  

Here enters the European Environment for Scientific Software Installations (EESSI) project, that provides a complete and optimized scientific software stack accessible from many different platforms: personal workstations, cloud and supercomputers. This allows users to work with the same software environment, regardless of the platform, OS, or architecture.   

Two distinct projects with different aims, but complementary: EESSI provides the scientific software and OOD the way to access it.">
