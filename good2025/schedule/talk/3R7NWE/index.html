        <meta name="description" content="Customization has always been important for institutions using Open OnDemand, but recent enhancements have made implementation, deployment, and management more seamless than ever. 

This talk will walk attendees through the evolution of Open OnDemand’s customization capabilities, highlighting the latest plugin features and the rendering of widget partials. It will then demonstrate how to develop and structure customizations as modular units that are easy to deploy and share, using practical examples like the metrics widget and the session card metrics developed by IQSS.

We’ll cover:
1. The Evolution of Customization in Open OnDemand – A brief look at how Open OnDemand’s customization options have grown over time, leading to the introduction of the latest plugin system.
2. Deploying Customizations – Step-by-step guidance on how to integrate and manage enhancements in the form of plugins within an Open OnDemand instance.
3. Creating Customizations – A hands-on walkthrough of how to develop customizations using the new plugins feature, including practical examples.
4. The Power of Sharing – How community-driven customization fosters innovation, allowing administrators and developers to try, create, and share enhancements that benefit the entire Open OnDemand ecosystem.

This talk is aimed at HPC administrators and developers who want to personalize their Open OnDemand instances. It will be informative and practical, offering attendees the know how to leverage these features in their own environments. By the end of the session, participants will understand how to develop and deploy customizations and take advantage of shared improvements from others.">
