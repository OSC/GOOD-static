        <meta name="description" content="RStudio Server is one of the most common Open OnDemand interactive apps. However, some R packages can be challenging to install due to numerous Linux package dependencies and/or substantial R package compile times. It may be difficult to replicate a successful package build at a later time due to different package/dependency versions.

The Rocker Project (https://rocker-project.org/) addresses the challenges of R package installation with community-supported container images that provide an extensive set of Linux software dependencies. In addition, they are preconfigured to install version-locked CRAN (R) packages from the Posit Public Package manager. The Bioconductor project (https://www.bioconductor.org/), a collection of R packages for bioinformatics, augments Rocker base images with additional Linux dependencies and configuration necessary to install almost any of the over 2,000 Bioconductor packages.

PostGIS (https://postgis.net) is a set of extensions and command-line utilities that adds geospatial data processing capabilities to the PostgreSQL (Postgres) relational database management system. An institutional HPC cluster, providing large-capacity compute, memory, and data storage, can be a fitting environment for geospatial (or other) applications that need to store and query massive amounts of data from a Postgres database. But deploying a Postgres/PostGIS database without administrator privileges can be daunting, especially in an HPC cluster environment.

The community Docker-PostGIS image (https://github.com/postgis/docker-postgis), based on the “Docker official” Postgres image (https://github.com/docker-library/postgres), provides a standardized software environment for deploying PostGIS. 

This talk illustrates Open OnDemand interactive apps that utilize these container images, including user forms, pre-launch setup to facilitate running as an unprivileged user (with Singularity or Apptainer), and workaround “gotchas”, and user-facing operational aspects. The same container images can be used from command-line-driven batch or interactive jobs to take advantage of their software environments outside of Open OnDemand as well.">

                    <p>We present our experience of leveraging several publicly available container projects for RStudio Server and PostGIS/PostgreSQL Open OnDemand interactive apps. These containers have pre-configured software stacks that facilitate easier application-specific package installation by users, reducing user support requests on computing center staff. This talk describes the user-friendly OOD interfaces to these complex apps and how the containers are launched on an HPC cluster with Singularity.</p>
