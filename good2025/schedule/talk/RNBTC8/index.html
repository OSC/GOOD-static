        <meta name="description" content="Today’s researcher is confronted with many new challenges and opportunities. Instruments are generating volumes of data, and there is a growing mandate to make data FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable). Modern tools and technologies are available to accelerate discoveries, but researchers must overcome many hurdles to take advantage of all the data that is available. Usage of remote storage and compute resources is becoming necessary, but is complicated to manage.
Globus and Open OnDemand aim to make it easier for researchers to focus on their research by automating data management and simplifying the use of advanced computing systems. The Globus service provides secure, reliable, and scalable data software tools and services designed to serve the data and compute management needs of the research community. And now, with the integration between Open OnDemand and Globus, moving and sharing of data of any size has become easier than ever.

In this session—aimed primarily at those new to Globus—we will demonstrate how Globus addresses data management challenges in the context of an Open OnDemand deployment and describe how the user experience is enhanced by a service that provides users with unified access to all their data.">

                    <p>Open OnDemand and Globus are natural partners: Open OnDemand lowers the barrier to using advanced computing resources while Globus removes the friction from data management. Using Globus to move and share data makes your Open OnDemand system even more valuable to researchers. In this talk we will demonstrate how the two systems integrate to help researchers reach data management and computation nirvana.</p>
