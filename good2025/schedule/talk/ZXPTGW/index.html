        <meta name="title" content="Creating and Deploying Singularity-Based Web Applications on Open OnDemand  - GOOD 2025 pretalx">
        <meta name="description" content="This talk will describe the process of creating and deploying Singularity-based interactive applications on the Open OnDemand environment. Singularity containers offer a secure and portable way to package applications. When combined with Open OnDemand, they enable easy scaling of single-user applications to multi-user environments, while offloading user management to the Open OnDemand environment. The talk will also cover the used of Streamlit for the creation of python-based web applications that integrate with Open OnDemand’s job submission system and shared file systems. Attendees will gain hands-on experience in deploying reproducible, and easily accessible applications in a high-throughput computing environment.
Outline: Introduction to Singularity and Streamlit; Overview of building Singularity containers; Overview of developing with Streamlit; Containerizing interactive applications - considerations for GUIs, data dependencies, and user-specific configurations; Setting up the Open OnDemand interactive application; Integrating Singularity containers with Open OnDemand; Scaling single-user applications for multi-user access; Best practices for resource allocation and performance optimization; Practical steps for attendees to deploy their own applications; Brief live demonstration; Q&amp;A and Discussion.
Why Attend: Attendees will gain practical knowledge of setting up a Singularity-based Open OnDemand interactive application and scaling single-user applications for multi-user access via Open OnDemand.
Who Should Attend: HPC administrators, researchers, and developers interested in containerizing web or GUI applications for deployment via the Open OnDemand environment. Basic familiarity with containerization concepts and Open OnDemand is helpful but not required.">
