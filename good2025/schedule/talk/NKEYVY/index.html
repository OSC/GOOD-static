        <meta name="description" content="The vision of the ERN is to simplify, support, catalyze, and foster multi-campus collaborations between academic institutions of all types and sizes across the U.S. that advance the frontiers of research, pedagogy, and innovation. Feedback from ERN research community outreach events identified barriers multi-institutional collaborations face utilizing remote scientific instruments and associated large data sets, typically located in an isolated lab. In response, ERN launched the CryoEM Remote Instrument Access Pilot project, supporting the democratization of these scientific research instruments, the large data sets they generate, infuse AI microservices into workflows, provide real-time parameter adjustments, optimize resource utilization, provide technical expertise, infrastructure and services necessary by lowering the barriers for scientists to engage in research that cross institutional and disciplinary boundaries. This talk will be an overview of the design of this active project, the initial development and deployment of our early stages, and a short video (3:40) of our initial success.  Links will be provided to our project’s website(https://www.ern.ci/cryoem-remote-instrument/)  for those interested in additional details found in several published white papers, and our GitHub repository for access to our open-source solution and potential contributions.

ERN has partnered with Rutgers’ CryoEM &amp; Nanoimaging Facility, who have a transmission electron microscope indirectly attached to the university’s network, with limited remote access behind a VPN and secure VNC server. We’ll review the initial and updated design components, which includes Open OnDemand at the core of our Instrument Portal, the scientific instrument and the desired workflow which can involve AI microservices and edge computing for real-time parameter adjustments in a closed loop. Discussions will cover security and networking modifications, the containerization of Open OnDemand paired with use of InCommon for credentials, our FABRIC Cloudlet build and advanced computing extension to Pittsburgh SuperComputing Center, followed by a short video.  Closing will discuss the github repository and our next efforts targeting the full build out of Identity and Resource Management.  Depending on the time allotted, some topics will be high level, but focus will remain on our core foundation, Open OnDemand, and the support and expertise provided aiding in our initial success.">

                    <p>The Ecosystem for Research Networking (ERN) CryoEM Remote Instrument Access Pilot Project aims to simplify wide-area internet access to scientific instruments and data sets by multi-institutional collaboration with emphasis on under-represented and under-resourced institutions. The goal is a secure, web-based portal, built upon containerized Open OnDemand, providing federated access to scientific instruments and associated large data sets;  generate workflows paired with AI microservices, edge computing, and advanced computing, for real-time experimental parameter adjustments and decisions. This talk will present an overview of the design and development efforts of this active project, concluding with a short video and link to the open-source GitHub repository for community participation.</p>
