A requirement of this project was that users from both institutions should feel like &quot;first-class citizens.&quot; We did not want to require, for example, a user from Lafayette to have Swarthmore guest account in order to access the cluster, or for a Swarthmore user to see a Lafayette domain and associated branding when using the system. Open OnDemand&#x27;s flexible architecture allowed us to configure CILogon as the authentication gateway, thus allowing users to login using their home credentials, while also providing configuration profiles to customize the experience for each institution. This is an elegant solution that can facilitate an arbitrary number of institutions sharing infrastructure and services under a single, unified Open OnDemand instance while maintaining specific branding and resources for each.">
