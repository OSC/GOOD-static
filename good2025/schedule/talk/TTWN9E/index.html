                    <p>The Universidad de Sonora (UNISON) has successfully integrated Open OnDemand to address the growing demand for high-performance computing (HPC) resources among researchers and students, particularly those in data science with limited technical expertise in HPC. This presentation will showcase how Open OnDemand has empowered non-specialized users by providing an intuitive interface to access advanced computational resources, enabling breakthroughs in data-driven research. By detailing our implementation strategy, user-focused approach, and the resulting benefits, we aim to highlight the transformative potential of Open OnDemand for institutions facing similar challenges.</p>
