        <meta name="description" content="High-Performance Computing (HPC) clusters play a pivotal role in scientific and biomedical research, engineering, and data-intensive applications. Open OnDemand (OOD), an open-source web portal is being optimized at our HPC centers to provide quicker access to HPC resources, offer a user-friendly interface to access computing resources, submit jobs, and monitor workflows. However, ensuring secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication is a critical challenge, especially in environments where diverse users from multiple institutions need access.
Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication provides a robust solution for managing access to HPC clusters through federated identity systems. By integrating SAML with Open OnDemand, users can utilize single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, enabling seamless access across multiple services while relying on their institution&#x27;s identity provider (IdP) for secure authentication. This reduces the need for maintaining separate credentials and simplifies access management for system administrators.
Implementing SAML authentication in OOD involves configuring the portal to communicate with SAML-compliant IdPs, such as Shibboleth and mapping user identities to cluster resources. This integration requires careful consideration of security policies, attribute mapping, and access control mechanisms to ensure secure operation in shared, multi-user environments.
The adoption of SAML authentication with Open OnDemand offers significant benefits, including Enhanced Security, Improved User Experience, Scalability, Streamlined Administration.
This approach is particularly valuable in collaborative research environments where multiple institutions share access to HPC resources. By leveraging federated identity systems, SAML-enabled Open OnDemand enhances the usability and security of HPC clusters, making them more accessible to a broader user community.
We present how this has been implemented at the HPC Clusters at the Africa Centers of Excellence (ACE) in Bioinformatics and Data intensive science in both East Africa, at Makerere University, Kampala Uganda and West Africa at the University of Science, Technique and Technology, Bamako Mali.">
