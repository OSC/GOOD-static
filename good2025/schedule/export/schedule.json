Open XDMoD is an application for monitoring cyberinfrastructure resources such as HPC clusters, storage, cloud, and OnDemand instances.  Open XDMoD provides standard metrics such as utilization, provides quality of service metrics designed to proactively identify underperforming system hardware and software, and can report job level performance data for every job running on the HPC system. \r\n\r\nThere are two types of OnDemand-XDMoD integration possible.  The first allows XDMoD user specific job usage graphs to display on the OnDemand dashboard.  Users are presented with information such as the most recent month's job efficiency report, core hours efficiency report, and recently completed job information.  The second part of the tutorial will demonstrate the xdmod-ondemand module, an optional add-on for Open XDMoD that allows for the display and analysis of Open OnDemand usage. This is intended to be used by HPC center staff to analyze who uses OnDemand at their center, how frequently it's used and what applications within OnDemand are utilized.\r\n\r\nThis tutorial will use the Docker container setup created for the HPC Toolset Tutorial and step participants through the configurations required for the two different integration options.  This tutorial will be fast paced and is intended for experienced HPC system administrators who are relatively familiar with the configuration of both Open XDMoD and Open OnDemand.

It quickly blossomed into an essential new way to not only teach but to facilitate research, for expert users but especially beginners. We have reached the point where in 2023, on our largest general-purpose HPC cluster, 41% of users ran at least one job with OOD.\r\n\r\nThe journey to that point involved a lot of learning about OOD but also about the needs of our user community. We now have Jupyter OOD apps that offer numerous different setups (e.g., per course, per Anaconda version) and that largely auto-detect user environments. Remote desktop via OOD uses our dedicated visualization nodes and a systemd-based scheduler that we contributed. MATLAB, Mathematica, RStudio, Stata and other apps are also available. File quota reports are available through a web interface as well.\r\n\r\nTo improve utilization of our clusters and help users optimize their jobs, we developed Jobstats, which is a job monitoring platform that includes OOD helper apps. For a given job ID, we have an app that generates a URL to a Grafana dashboard that shows detailed job metrics as a function of time. These metrics include the CPU/GPU utilization and CPU/GPU memory usage as well as useful node-level metrics. The dashboard is helpful when trying to understand why a job failed and for troubleshooting system performance issues.\r\n\r\nTo meet the recent demand for GPUs for classes and training workshops, we have configured our local OOD implementation to burst to the cloud. We will discuss the various unexpected problems that arose while creating this service as well as their solutions. Feedback from instructors and students will be presented.\r\n\r\nWhile OOD is working well for the majority of use cases, a certain set of issues continually arise. For instance, we receive a steady stream of support tickets from users with sessions that will not start. While support staff is capable of resolving the matter, more can be done with OOD to identify the problem and present the solution to the user in an understandable way.

Real-world deployments of HPC in healthcare settings have been limited by the challenges of working with sensitive healthcare data within restricted network and operational environments. In Australia, health data cannot be processed outside of the country and in most cases cannot leave the hospital data centre due to privacy requirements. The large Australian public supercomputers NCI GADI and Pawsey Supercomputing Centre do not permit the storage and analysis of healthcare data. Accordingly, Australian medical HPC research has focused on genomic analysis, drug discovery and corporate AI model development. Recently, we deployed a small on-premises HPC research cluster with Open OnDemand (OOD) inside Perth Children\u2019s Hospital primarily to facilitate the use of large language models (LLMs) on sensitive hospital data. \r\nOur team comprises software engineers, data analysts and end users i.e. research assistants, anaesthetists and other healthcare staff who use AI models as part of everyday clinical work. We deployed OOD with the intention of enabling a variety of interactive and batch computing jobs to suit the needs of our users. We realised that there are many containerised low-code LLM web applications that would be suitable to use by non-technical users and that can be contextualised with locally developed language models and techniques such as retrieval augmented generation (RAG). \r\nWe implemented a containerised workflow using Podman Compose to orchestrate container services and to expose web services over the OOD reverse proxy. Our environment constraints mean that most users share the same node, so we additionally restrict applications to only expose ports over an authenticated Caddy reverse proxy. The hospital environment is strictly locked down and as such some web applications required patching to render client-side URLs prefixed with the OOD reverse proxy path. Future work to simplify this process is planned.\r\nThis enables an end-to-end workflow where technical researchers are able to use batch jobs to finetune and deploy models locally for use by non-technical end users in clinical situations using open-source user-friendly web applications over OOD. We believe this workflow democratises access to LLM and HPC resources and allows our team to be more agile in developing and validating LLMs in clinical settings.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 24, "code": "MVBZY3", "public_name": "Harry Smallbone [University of Western Australia]", "biography": "Harry is a junior medical doctor in Western Australia working in internal medicine and a PhD candidate at the University of Western Australia investigating the use of artificial intelligence in paediatric anaesthesia.

However, transitioning from wet-lab work to bioinformatics requires new skills, with the Linux command-line interface posing a significant challenge. Open OnDemand (OOD) provides a solution by offering a web-based interface that simplifies HPC access without extensive command-line navigation.\r\nSome bioinformatics applications come with a GUI, making them suitable for OOD. At Tufts HPC, we have deployed containerized versions of popular tools like CellProfiler, FastQC, QualiMap, and Relion as OOD apps. Our custom RStudio Server for bioinformatics is particularly popular, offering a user-friendly web-based interface superior to RStudio Desktop. We researched user needs and pre-installed over 1,300 R packages, supporting a wide range of analyses beyond bioinformatics. Users can also install additional packages in their $HOME directory.\r\nWhile most OOD apps are GUI-based, some command-line tools also benefit greatly from OOD integration. AlphaFold, the recipient of the 2024 Nobel Prize in Chemistry, serves as a prime example. Running AlphaFold via the command line involves complex database paths and parameters. OOD simplifies this by managing configurations behind the scenes. Since deploying AlphaFold on OOD, most users prefer this version. In classrooms, even undergraduates with limited command-line skills have successfully submitted AlphaFold GPU jobs via OOD and obtained predicted protein structures. \r\nnf-core is a global initiative providing over 120 open-source analysis pipelines built with Nextflow, enhancing research with consistency and reproducibility in genomics and beyond.

Open OnDemand (OOD), an open-source web portal is being optimized at our HPC centers to provide quicker access to HPC resources, offer a user-friendly interface to access computing resources, submit jobs, and monitor workflows. However, ensuring secure, scalable, and user-friendly authentication is a critical challenge, especially in environments where diverse users from multiple institutions need access.\r\nSecurity Assertion Markup Language (SAML) authentication provides a robust solution for managing access to HPC clusters through federated identity systems. By integrating SAML with Open OnDemand, users can utilize single sign-on (SSO) capabilities, enabling seamless access across multiple services while relying on their institution's identity provider (IdP) for secure authentication. This reduces the need for maintaining separate credentials and simplifies access management for system administrators.\r\nImplementing SAML authentication in OOD involves configuring the portal to communicate with SAML-compliant IdPs, such as Shibboleth and mapping user identities to cluster resources. This integration requires careful consideration of security policies, attribute mapping, and access control mechanisms to ensure secure operation in shared, multi-user environments.\r\nThe adoption of SAML authentication with Open OnDemand offers significant benefits, including Enhanced Security, Improved User Experience, Scalability, Streamlined Administration.\r\nThis approach is particularly valuable in collaborative research environments where multiple institutions share access to HPC resources. By leveraging federated identity systems, SAML-enabled Open OnDemand enhances the usability and security of HPC clusters, making them more accessible to a broader user community.\r\nWe present how this has been implemented at the HPC Clusters at the Africa Centers of Excellence (ACE) in Bioinformatics and Data intensive science in both East Africa, at Makerere University, Kampala Uganda and West Africa at the University of Science, Technique and Technology, Bamako Mali.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 52, "code": "WPF3NV", "public_name": "Rodgers Kimera [Research Data and Communication Technologies]", "biography": "Rodgers Kimera holds a BSc in Computer Engineering from Busitema University, Uganda and MSc in Computer Science from Victoria University, Uganda.

Typical causes for underutilization include jobs that over-allocate CPUs, CPU memory, or both. Such instances are frequently due to misunderstandings or in some cases by accident. The introduction of GPUs has made the problem more pressing. Two common problems are (1) jobs that allocate GPUs but do not use them and (2) jobs that use them but only with little utilization.\r\n\r\nAt Princeton, we have started to continuously monitor nodes (including the GPUs) and filesystems using various Prometheus exporters. Our integrated solution is called Jobstats. The monitoring data is combined with the workload manager (Slurm) data to produce job efficiency reports. These reports provide metadata about the job as well as CPU/GPU utilization, CPU/GPU memory usage, and job-specific notes to guide users.\r\n\r\nThe Jobstat platform includes an OOD Helper App. For a given job ID, the app generates a URL to a Grafana dashboard that shows various job-level and node-level metrics as a function of time. The job-level metrics include the CPU/GPU utilization and CPU/GPU memory usage. Some examples of the node-level metrics are the mean CPU frequencies, GPFS bandwidth statistics, and the number of InfiniBand errors. The dashboard is helpful when trying to understand why a job failed and for troubleshooting system issues. Jobstats also makes it possible to see the high-level job efficiency data on the \u201cCompleted Jobs\u201d page of the OOD web interface. The \u201cActive Jobs\u201d page shows plots of CPU utilization and memory usage with a link to the detailed job statistics on Grafana.\r\n\r\nThe combination of the OOD Helper App, the Grafana interface, and the command-line tools, makes it easy for users and system administrators to inspect the utilization and usage of individual jobs.

This setup enables the delivery of tailored, isolated software environments for each classroom, ensuring a seamless and efficient learning experience for students and instructors. Each classroom environment is managed by the instructor, who can install, and update packages as needed. When students log into a course hosted on the classroom server, they are provided with the custom R or Python environment configured by the instructor. This eliminates the need for students to install packages themselves, ensuring consistency and reducing setup time. Additionally, these environments are isolated from other Python or R workflows the user may already have in their accounts, preventing conflicts and maintaining a clean, course-specific workspace. \r\nInstructors can also easily share data and other files for students to use for assignments.

This is a great example of integration between software user friendliness and compliance with best practices for scientific reproducibility.\r\nTo further support users, we have integrated widely used imaging applications such as Fiji and QuPath into OOD. Wet-lab researchers can now perform image analysis, data inspection, and computational tasks within a unified platform, minimizing the friction that often separates bench work from in silico exploration eliminating the tricky proliferation of standalone ad-hoc workstations linked to specific scientific instruments.\r\nIn summary, OOD at IFOM demonstrates how a thoughtfully designed computational gateway can democratize access to powerful data analysis resources,closing the gap between experimental biology and computational infrastructure, promoting research efficiency.

In addition, the Performance Metrics app provides information about the resource efficiency of users\u2019 jobs, comparing their requested CPU cores, memory, and time with the amount they actually utilize. The goal of these three apps is to be as user-friendly and intuitive as possible while providing detailed information that users want to know regarding their jobs and the Anvil supercomputer. We want to share the features and improvements being worked on for Anvil\u2019s Open OnDemand dashboard as well as generate feedback and discussion about further potential Open OnDemand improvements to eventually contribute these changes back to the Open OnDemand community.", "recording_license": "", "do_not_record": false, "persons": [{"id": 56, "code": "W338JT", "public_name": "Richie Tan [Purdue]", "biography": "Hello, I am an undergraduate student studying Computer Science at Purdue University.
