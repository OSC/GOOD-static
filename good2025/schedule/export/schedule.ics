DESCRIPTION:Open OnDemand (OOD) is ideally placed to bridge the divide betw
 een traditional shell-based batch HPC and emerging large language model (L
 LM) workflows. Our team deployed OOD internally at MERLIN\, a small HPC re
 search cluster located inside Perth Children’s Hospital to provide HPC r
 esources to a range of technical and non-technical users on sensitive heal
 thcare data. We adapted existing LLM web applications for OOD to provide a
  low-code playground for non-technical researchers such as medical doctors
  and research assistants to engage with LLM resources in a healthcare envi
 ronment. This presentation will discuss the rationale\, and implementation
  of OOD LLM web applications in a highly restricted environment and motiva
 te future improved support for these types of workflows within OOD.

DESCRIPTION:Some organizations\, such as CSC - IT Center for Science\, prov
 ide the users with access to multiple supercomputers\, where each of the s
 upercomputers may have completely separate instances of Open OnDemand. Thi
 s leads to a fragmented user experience\, where the user is required to lo
 g in to another instance to access another supercomputer\, as well as incr
 eased time spent on maintaining multiple instances. This talk targets syst
 em administrators\, service owners\, and other persons responsible for mai
 ntaining and developing Open OnDemand instances\, and discusses the benefi
 ts and challenges of providing a single instance of Open OnDemand\, which 
 is connected to all of the organization's supercomputers and potentially e

 as well as quirks\nwhich only become visible at a larger scale.\n\nThis te

 the OOD\nupstream\, as well as architectural impacts of using Passenger.\n
 A general understanding of the OOD architecture\, Passenger's role in it\,

DESCRIPTION:Not all commercially available software will run on Linux or Wi
 ne\, compelling researchers to request Windows in HPC environments. Tradit
 ional solutions demand dedicated servers\, Active Directory infrastructure
 \, and specialized IT staff. 7lbd (7-layer bean dip) is an open-source pro
 ject that eliminates this overhead by treating Windows as "just another Op
 en OnDemand application\," allowing users to launch secure Windows desktop
 s in an isolated environment anywhere on their cluster while maintaining a
 ccess to all of the user’s files. This solution simplifies Windows to a 
 level that even Linux systems administrators will find easy to maintain.

DESCRIPTION:High-Performance Computing (HPC) workforce development initiati
 ves aimed to train diverse stakeholders in essential tools and methods. Th
 e "blinking cursor" barrier in terminal interfaces was addressed by integr
 ating Open OnDemand within the projectEUREKA platform\, facilitating 18 gr
 oups of MSI undergraduates and faculty in cyberinfrastructure-targeted hac
 kathons. These time-bounded events\, based on the HackHPC Model\, addresse
 d the HPC skills gap through intensive applied training. This presentation
  will compare traditional terminal/CLI-based and web-GUI-based training ap
 proaches\, examining their evolution and effectiveness. Additionally\, mod
 ified outcomes and artifacts produced by participants will provide insight
 s into the impact of these training methodologies.

DESCRIPTION:An up-to-the-minute status report of the configuration and avai
 lability of HPC resources can be useful for selecting resource parameters 
 in interactive apps. GPU node resources can be low at times leaving few or
  no GPUs available for immediate use when launching interactive apps. By p
 roviding the status of readily available GPU node resources such as the ty
 pe and number of GPUs\, CPU cores and GB of memory\, users can more effici
 ently utilize cluster resources and minimize job queue wait times.

DESCRIPTION:The Anvil supercomputer\, funded by the NSF and maintained by P
 urdue University\, powers research across the country. Anvil’s web dashb
 oard is an Open OnDemand portal with just the base features\, including cr
 eating jobs and viewing the job queue. However\, a lot of information is l
 ocked behind Slurm terminal commands and other scripts\, making it difficu
 lt for researchers without terminal knowledge to access the information pr
 ovided by these commands. The goal of this project is to create a detailed
 \, user-friendly dashboard built off of Open OnDemand to provide useful in
 formation about the cluster and their own jobs. This improved dashboard en
 ables researchers to more efficiently conduct their research and access co
 mmonly-needed cluster information without learning complex terminal comman
 ds.

DESCRIPTION:Texas  A&M has a long history of creating Apps for OpenOnDemand
  to improve the user experience. In this presentation\, we will present tw
 o of our latest projects. We will briefly show our new experimental custom
 izable dashboard\, where users can manage their resources and interact wit
 h the HPRC helpdesk. Next\, we will show the Drona workflow engine\, a fra
 mework for composing and generating custom workflows. Drona abstracts the 
 researcher as much as possible from HPC specifics normally required to run
  their jobs on our clusters so they can focus on their research. This incl
 udes setting up custom environments and automatically selecting resources.
  A major application is to assist researchers in creating and running thei
 r AI workloads on a variety of accelerators.
