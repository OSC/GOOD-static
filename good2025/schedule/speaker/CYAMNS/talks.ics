DESCRIPTION:This BoF will bring together administrators from different inst
 itutions who use OOD in a teaching context. We will have a panel of presen
 ters to talk about how OOD is implemented for teaching in their implementa
 tion\, and then open up the floor for discussion with the panel. This BoF 
 is intended to be useful to developers and administrators who are responsi
 ble for OOD in teaching use cases\, as well as instructors who want a bett
 er understanding of what's going on behind the scenes with the platforms t
 hey use. It's our hope that this sharing of ideas will result in a lot of 
 learning from different solutions to similar problems unique to deploying 
 OOD for teaching.
