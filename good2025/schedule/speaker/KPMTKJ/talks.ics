DESCRIPTION:There are thousands of scientific and HPC applications that use
 rs need to carry out their work. OOD offers an incredible resource for use
 rs to access these applications\, but how best to understand the existing 
 OOD Apps\, to learn from them\, and to create your own? In this poster\, w
 e propose a simple\, centralized repository for OOD Apps and some basic gu
 idelines for creating and sharing new ones.

DESCRIPTION:This BoF will bring together administrators from different inst
 itutions who use OOD in a teaching context. We will have a panel of presen
 ters to talk about how OOD is implemented for teaching in their implementa
 tion\, and then open up the floor for discussion with the panel. This BoF 
 is intended to be useful to developers and administrators who are responsi
 ble for OOD in teaching use cases\, as well as instructors who want a bett
 er understanding of what's going on behind the scenes with the platforms t
 hey use. It's our hope that this sharing of ideas will result in a lot of 
 learning from different solutions to similar problems unique to deploying 
 OOD for teaching.

DESCRIPTION:Open OnDemand (OOD) is a transformative tool for Research and H
 igh Performance Computing Centers -- but getting it up-and-running at your
  institution can feel daunting. We recently took on this challenge\, and t
 rust me\, if one guy from a small team at a small school can do it\, then 
 so can you! I will talk about excellent resources I had\, lessons I learne
 d\, and some key takeaways from the experience. If you are considering OOD
  for your institution\, then this is your chance to hear some positive fir
 st-hand experience.
